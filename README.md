# MASTER CLAUDE ☕

**A free, open-source Claude Code team.** Say **"master claude"** and a *leader* interviews you, maps your
project, and assembles a tailored team — **Sentinel** the project cartographer plus planning, review,
understanding and guardrail specialists — then runs it on your work. It also keeps itself (and you) current
with the newest Claude Code features.

No account. No API key. No vault. It's just markdown you drop into `.claude/` — everything is local, plain text, and open.

## What it is
MASTER CLAUDE is a set of Claude Code **skills** and **agents** — all plain `.md` files, organized by
category — plus a **leader** skill (`master-claude`) that ties them together. You add the markdown to your
project's `.claude/` folder (or your global `~/.claude/`) and it's live. Instead of installing a dozen tools
you'll forget, you say "master claude" once — it figures out what
*this* project and *this* developer need, assembles the smallest team that helps, gets to work, and brings
in more members the moment a need shows up.

## Requirements
**Claude Code ≥ 2.1.183** (the categorized skill folders rely on nested-skill discovery). Check with
`claude --version`; if you're behind, run `claude update`.

## Set up
MASTER CLAUDE is `.md` files you drop into `.claude/`. Pick either path:

**A. Let Claude Code set it up (easiest).** In your project, paste this to Claude Code:

> I want to use MASTER CLAUDE (https://github.com/MasterClaudeTeam/MasterClaude) in this project. Clone the repo,
> copy its `skills/`, `agents/` and `commands/` folders into this project's `.claude/` directory, then load
> and run the `master-claude` skill to set up my team.

**B. Manual (git).**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MasterClaudeTeam/MasterClaude /tmp/mc
mkdir -p .claude && cp -r /tmp/mc/skills /tmp/mc/agents /tmp/mc/commands .claude/
```
Use `~/.claude/` instead of `.claude/` to enable it for **every** project. The optional Sentinel hook and
full details are in **[SETUP.md](SETUP.md)**.

**Then run it** — in any project, say:
```
master claude — set up my team for this project
```
(or `/master-claude`). It interviews you, maps the repo, and assembles your team. See your team any time
with `/master-claude-team`.

## The team
The leader picks a **minimal** subset per project — never all at once. Capabilities are organized by
category; each folder has a README that brainstorms what else belongs there (good first contributions).

- **`agents/`** — **Sentinel** (project cartographer → `.sentinel/`) and the **Security Auditor**
  (read-only vulnerability audit → `.security/`). Read-only toward your source.
- **`skills/planning/`** — `grill-me` · `cap-brainstorm` · `cap-plan-first` · `cap-spec-smith` ·
  `cap-decomposer` · `cap-write-plan` · `cap-execute-plan` — fuzzy ask → spec → plan → built result.
- **`skills/review/`** — `cap-self-review` · `cap-red-team` — critique the diff and the design.
- **`skills/understand/`** — `cap-explain-senior` · `cap-rubber-duck` · `codehistorian` · `repo-map`
  (a ranked code map for token-cheap navigation) — explain, debug, trace history, map the codebase.
- **`skills/guardrails/`** (the Guardian suite) — `guardian` · `supplyguard` · `testmedic` · `cap-tdd` ·
  `debtradar` · `compactor` · `guardian-suite` — keep the work honest and the codebase healthy.
- **`skills/frontend/`** — `fe-design-system` · `fe-page-patterns` · `fe-component-craft` · `fe-from-reference` ·
  `fe-design-review` — make the UI output excellent (tokens → layout → accessible/responsive components → review).
- **`skills/security/`** — `sec-authz-review` · `sec-attacker-review` · `sec-injection` · `sec-authn-session` ·
  `sec-secrets-crypto` · `sec-ssrf-traversal` — review for vulnerabilities, front→back (OWASP/CWE, with fixes).
- **`skills/workflows/`** — `wf-codebase-audit`, `wf-security-audit` — big, multi-step jobs.
- **`skills/automation/`** — `god-mode` (an autonomous, resumable build; asks only for the critical) ·
  `god-mode-zeus` (the dangerously, never-ask tier) · `scheduling` (cron/schtasks/launchd recurring runs) ·
  `clone` (a Telegram-fronted digital-twin assistant — immortal session, grows a private brain repo).
- **`skills/orchestration/`** — `subagent-orchestration` (delegate to subagents/teams) · `model-router`
  (pick a model per agent — Opus lead / Sonnet workers / Haiku scouts) · `token-economy` (best output per
  token — caveman, cheaper models, cache-warm) · `workspace-architect` (the best `.claude/` setup per
  project) · `worktree-isolation` (parallel work without collisions).
- **`skills/meta/`** — `writing-skills` (author or sharpen a MASTER CLAUDE skill) · `statusline-designer`
  (design a custom Claude Code status line for CLI users — gated, opt-in) — so the archive keeps growing.

## How it works
1. **Interview (grill-me).** Developer → want → purpose → project → environment — one sharp question at a
   time, each with a recommended default. It explores the repo first and never asks what the code answers.
2. **Map.** Detects your stack and the gaps for *this* goal.
3. **Assemble.** Picks a tailored team from the installed skills and explains why each fits.
4. **Run.** Actually does the work with the team, and tells you what each member changed.

## GOD mode — build until you say stop
Hand MASTER CLAUDE a goal and let it run. **GOD mode** (`/master-claude:god-mode "<goal>"`) reviews the
situation — improve an existing project or build one from scratch — writes a mission + prioritized backlog
under `.mc/god-mode/`, then executes **relentlessly, without pausing for confirmation**. Anything
that needs *you* — production, real secrets, money, publishing, irreversible actions — goes to a **BLOCKERS**
list and it keeps working everything else; nothing idles.

It's built to be unkillable except by you. State lives on disk, so it survives `/compact`, crashes, and
reboots. For a true walk-away run, launch the bundled runner — it **auto-resumes after a usage limit** and
stops only on a manual `STOP`:
```bash
node .claude/skills/automation/god-mode/runner.mjs        # keeps going across usage limits
touch .mc/god-mode/STOP             # stop it (or Ctrl-C)
```
The safety rails always hold: no production, secrets, money, or destructive actions without you, tests stay
honest, and a manual stop always wins. By default GOD mode **asks you about the genuinely critical /
high-access calls** and defers the rest.

Want it to run **dark** and never ask? **ZEUS** (`/master-claude:god-mode-zeus`, or `runner.mjs --zeus`) is
the separate *dangerously* tier — it runs with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, never pauses to ask, and
pushes maximum autonomy, for when you accept full risk. (The catastrophe rails still hold.) Pair either with
**scheduling** (`/master-claude:schedule`) for nightly sweeps, weekly audits, or a daily push on the backlog.

## Staying up to date
MASTER CLAUDE keeps itself current — it's your guide to the best of Claude Code. Ask it **"what's new"**
(or run `/master-claude:whats-new`) and it checks your Claude Code version, reads the official changelog,
and flags the new features relevant to *your* work.
- **Update MASTER CLAUDE:** just ask it to **"update yourself"** — it `git pull`s the repo and re-copies
  `skills/ agents/ commands/` into `.claude/`. (Or do it by hand, same two commands as setup.)
- **Update Claude Code:** `claude update`.

## Sentinel — the cartographer
Sentinel holds your whole repo as a living map and keeps it honest: every module, entry point, and
invariant recorded; every gap / bug / missing test surfaced as a tracked, cross-linked finding. It is
**read-only toward your source** — it only ever writes under `.sentinel/`.
- `/sentinel:map` — build (or rebuild) the full map and initial findings.
- `/sentinel:sweep` — review what changed since the last run.
- `/sentinel:report` — show the current map + open findings.

A session hook nudges you when the map drifts behind HEAD or criticals are open.

## Customization
Drop a `.claude/master-claude.json` in your project to steer the leader (all keys optional):
```json
{
  "autonomy": "ask",
  "verbosity": "normal",
  "defaultGuardrails": ["guardian", "sentinel"],
  "preferredEcosystem": ["superpowers"],
  "offProactive": false
}
```

## Plays nicely with the wider ecosystem
MASTER CLAUDE will recommend (never force) external tools when they fit: **[superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers)**
(broad TDD/review + subagent base), **[mattpocock/skills](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills)** (the
original `grill-me` + engineering skills), **gsd** (spec-driven autonomous builds), **caveman** (fewer output
tokens on long sessions). We learn from the best of the community and build our own — we **don't vendor their
files**; we credit them and point you upstream. The full list + what each taught us is in
**[docs/ECOSYSTEM.md](docs/ECOSYSTEM.md)**.

## Contributing
This is a community project — PRs welcome. Add or sharpen a skill, an agent, or a workflow; each category
folder brainstorms what's needed (including **stack-specific** ideas). Contributors who want it can share a
**TON address with their PRs** and receive a slice of the month's donations (see below). Start here:
